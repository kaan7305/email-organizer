‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started
Follow these steps to set up and run the Email Insight application locally on your machine.

Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following software installed:

Node.js: Download and install Node.js (LTS version recommended)

npm: (Node Package Manager, comes with Node.js) or Yarn

1. Clone the Repository
First, clone the project repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/email-summarizer-app.git
cd email-summarizer-app

(Replace YOUR_USERNAME with your actual GitHub username)

2. Install Dependencies
Navigate into the project directory and install the necessary npm packages:

npm install
# or if you use Yarn
# yarn install

3. Environment Variables Setup (Crucial!)
To connect to Firebase and OpenAI, you need to set up environment variables. This is vital for security, especially when sharing your code publicly.

Create a new file named .env in the root of your project directory (the same level as package.json). Add the following variables to it, replacing the placeholder values with your actual keys:

REACT_APP_FIREBASE_API_KEY=YOUR_FIREBASE_API_KEY
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=YOUR_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=YOUR_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=YOUR_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=YOUR_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_APP_ID=YOUR_FIREBASE_APP_ID
REACT_APP_OPENAI_API_KEY=YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY

How to obtain your keys:

Firebase Configuration:

Go to the Firebase Console.

Select your project (or create a new one).

Click on "Project settings" (the gear icon next to "Project overview").

Under the "General" tab, scroll down to "Your apps" and select the web app. You'll find your firebaseConfig object there. Copy the values for apiKey, authDomain, projectId, storageBucket, messagingSenderId, and appId.

OpenAI API Key:

Go to the OpenAI API dashboard.

Click on "Create new secret key."

Copy the generated key.

Important: Ensure your .env file is included in your .gitignore to prevent accidentally committing your sensitive keys to version control.

4. Run the Application
Once the dependencies are installed and environment variables are set, you can start the development server:

npm start
# or if you use Yarn
# yarn start

The application will compile and automatically open in your default web browser, usually at http://localhost:3000.
